            <h2>Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo </h2>Born 13 June 1963
            is a Congolese politician who has been the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 25 January 2019.
            He is the leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), 
            the oldest and largest party of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
            succeeding his late father Étienne Tshisekedi in that role, 
            a three-time Prime Minister of Zaire and opposition leader during the reign of Mobutu Sese Seko.
            Tshisekedi was the UDPS party's candidate for president in the December 2018 general election, 
            which he won, despite accusations of irregularities from several election monitoring organisations and other opposition parties. 
            His victory was upheld by the Constitutional Court of the DRC after another opposition politician, 
            Martin Fayulu, challenged the result, but Tshisekedi has been accused of making a deal with his predecessor, 
            Joseph Kabila. The election marked the first peaceful transition of power since the DRC became independent from Belgium in 1960.

                Early life and education
            </h2>
            Tshisekedi, a member of the Luba ethnic group, 
            was born in Kinshasa on 13 June 1963 to mother Marthe and father Étienne Tshisekedi, 
            who served as Prime Minister of Zaire in the 1990s. 
            Félix Tshisekedi had a comfortable life as a youth in the capital. 
            However, when his father created the UDPS in the early 1980s, publicly opposing Mobutu, 
            Félix was forced to accompany his dissident father into house arrest in his native village in central Kasaï. 
            This led to him putting his studies on hold. In 1985, Mobutu authorised him, his mother, and his brothers to leave Kasaï. 
            He went on to live in Brussels, Belgium, where he worked at odd jobs and became an active UDPS militant.
